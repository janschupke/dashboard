# PRP: Refactor Uranium Tile to Unified Data Architecture

## Feature Overview

Refactor the Uranium tile to use the new unified data fetching architecture, ensuring it uses `fetchAndParse` for scraping-based retrieval and is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new structure.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see up-to-date uranium price data in the dashboard.
- As a developer, I want the Uranium tile to use the centralized dataFetcher and a registered parser for all data access.

## Technical Requirements

- Update the Uranium tile’s data hook to use `fetchAndParse` from `dataFetcher`.
- Implement and register a parser for Trading Economics HTML scraping.
- Ensure the tile’s dataMapper is registered and used correctly.
- Update types/interfaces as needed for consistency.
- Add or update unit tests for the tile’s data hook, data mapping, and parser.

## UI/UX Considerations

- Tile must display loading, error, and data states consistently.
- No changes to the visual design unless required for error/loading handling.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for the data hook, data mapping, and parser.
- Mock all scraping calls in tests.
- Ensure error and loading states are tested.

## Accessibility Requirements

- Tile must remain accessible (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

## Performance Considerations

- Ensure caching and background refresh logic is respected.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor the tile’s data hook to use `fetchAndParse`.
2. Implement and register a parser for Trading Economics HTML.
3. Ensure the dataMapper is registered and used.
4. Update types/interfaces as needed.
5. Add/update unit tests.
6. Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues.
7. Perform structure check and fix inconsistencies.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking data flow or parser logic. **Mitigation:** Add comprehensive tests and verify tile works after refactor.
