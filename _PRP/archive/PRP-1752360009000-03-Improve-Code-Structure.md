## Implementation Details

### Files to Modify
1. `src/components/dashboard/tiles/CryptocurrencyTile.tsx` (old duplicate)
2. `src/components/dashboard/tiles/PreciousMetalsTile.tsx` (old duplicate)
3. All import statements that reference old tile components
4. Any files with inconsistent naming conventions
5. Any files in incorrect locations
6. Components that don't follow self-contained architecture

### Specific Changes Required
1. Remove old duplicate tile components:
   - `src/components/dashboard/tiles/CryptocurrencyTile.tsx`
   - `src/components/dashboard/tiles/PreciousMetalsTile.tsx`
2. Update all imports to use new self-contained tile implementations:
   - `src/components/dashboard/tiles/cryptocurrency/CryptocurrencyTile.tsx`
   - `src/components/dashboard/tiles/precious-metals/PreciousMetalsTile.tsx`
3. Ensure all files follow naming conventions:
   - PascalCase for components
   - camelCase for utilities
   - kebab-case for directories
4. Verify file locations match project structure
5. Update any components that don't follow self-contained tile architecture

### Self-Contained Tile Architecture
Each tile should follow this structure:
```
src/components/dashboard/tiles/[tile-name]/
├── [TileName].tsx          # Main component
├── constants.ts            # Tile-specific constants
├── types.ts               # Tile-specific types
├── hooks/                 # Tile-specific hooks
│   └── use[TileName]Data.ts
└── services/              # Tile-specific services
    └── [tileName]Api.ts
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Run `npm run build` to verify no import errors
2. Run `npm run lint` to verify no linting issues
3. Run `npm run test:run` to verify all tests pass
4. Test all user interactions to ensure no regressions
5. Verify all tile functionality works correctly
