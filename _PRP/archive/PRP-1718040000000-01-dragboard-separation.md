# PRP-1718040000000-01-Dragboard-Separation

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name

Dragboard: Modular, Draggable Dashboard Framework

### Brief Description

The Dragboard is a standalone, modular dashboard framework within Nerdboard. It provides a flexible, draggable grid for arranging tiles, with a clear separation from the rest of the project. All interactions with Dragboard are routed through its documented interface, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience for both users and developers.

### User Value

- Users experience a more stable, predictable dashboard with improved performance and fewer bugs.
- Developers can easily integrate, update, or extract Dragboard as a reusable library, enabling rapid customization and future enhancements.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** dashboard user
**I want** to arrange, move, and manage tiles on my dashboard smoothly
**So that** I can personalize my workspace to fit my needs

### Additional User Stories

- **As a** developer, **I want** to interact with Dragboard only through its public interface, **so that** integration is simple and future updates are seamless.
- **As a** user, **I want** the sidebar and other features to work smoothly with Dragboard, **so that** my experience is consistent and intuitive.
- **As a** developer, **I want** clear documentation and examples for using Dragboard, **so that** I can quickly understand and implement dashboard features.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Users can drag, drop, and rearrange tiles on the dashboard.
- [ ] All interactions with Dragboard from other components use only the interface exposed in `dragboard/index.ts`.
- [ ] Sidebar and other features remain fully functional and decoupled from Dragboard internals.
- [ ] Dragboard documentation is up-to-date, describing its interface and usage examples.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] The dashboard remains responsive and performant during drag-and-drop operations.
- [ ] The user experience is consistent across devices and browsers.
- [ ] The Dragboard interface is stable and versioned for future compatibility.

## Technical Requirements

### Implementation Details

- **Component Structure**: All Dragboard-related components reside in `src/components/dragboard/`. Only `index.ts` is used as the public interface for other parts of the app.
- **State Management**: Dragboard receives all state via props/context. It does not manage persistence or app-specific logic internally.
- **API Integration**: Dragboard does not perform any API calls or data fetching.
- **Data Persistence**: All persistence is handled externally (e.g., via `storageManager`). Dragboard is agnostic to storage mechanisms.
- **Sidebar Integration**: Any sidebar interactions with Dragboard must use the public interface. Refactor sidebar code if it accesses Dragboard internals directly.
- **Documentation**: Update `src/components/dragboard/README.md` to reflect the current interface, usage, and examples.

#### Example: Using Dragboard Interface

```typescript
// src/components/dragboard/index.ts
import { DragboardGrid, DragboardProvider } from './DragboardGrid';

export { DragboardGrid, DragboardProvider };

// Usage in App
import { DragboardGrid, DragboardProvider } from '../components/dragboard';

<DragboardProvider>
  <DragboardGrid tiles={tiles} onTileMove={handleTileMove} />
</DragboardProvider>
```

## UI/UX Considerations

- The dashboard layout is intuitive, with clear visual feedback during drag-and-drop.
- Sidebar actions and tile management are seamless and do not expose internal Dragboard logic to users.
- Documentation includes user-facing guides and developer usage examples.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Testing**: Test Dragboard components for correct rendering, drag-and-drop logic, and prop handling.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure sidebar and other components interact with Dragboard only via the public interface. Test end-to-end tile movement and layout persistence.
- **Performance Testing**: Validate that drag-and-drop operations remain performant with a large number of tiles.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and focus management are implemented for Dragboard interactions.
- **Coverage Target**: >80% for all Dragboard-related code.

## Accessibility Requirements

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All drag-and-drop operations must be accessible via keyboard.
- **Screen Reader Support**: Use ARIA roles and labels for Dragboard and tiles.
- **Color Contrast**: All visual feedback must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.
- **Focus Management**: Ensure focus is managed correctly during and after drag operations.

## Performance Considerations

- **Initial Load Time**: Dragboard should not significantly impact dashboard load time.
- **Component Render Time**: Dragboard and tiles should render in <100ms.
- **Data Refresh Rate**: Dragboard should handle rapid tile movements without lag.
- **Memory Usage**: Efficiently manage state to avoid memory leaks during drag operations.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Sidebar or other components bypass Dragboard's public interface.
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Refactor and enforce usage of `index.ts` interface; add tests to catch direct imports.
- **Risk**: Dragboard documentation becomes outdated.
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Update documentation as part of the PRP acceptance criteria.

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: Drag-and-drop is not accessible to all users.
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Implement and test keyboard navigation and ARIA support.

## Documentation Requirements

- **Component Documentation**: All Dragboard components and interfaces are documented with clear usage notes.
- **README Updates**: The Dragboard folder contains an updated README with its current state, public interface, and usage examples.
- **User Guide**: End-user documentation describes how to personalize the dashboard using Dragboard features.

## Implementation Plan (User-Facing)

- [ ] Ensure all dashboard interactions are routed through Dragboard's public interface.
- [ ] Update sidebar and related features to use only the Dragboard interface.
- [ ] Review and update Dragboard documentation, including usage examples and interface details.
