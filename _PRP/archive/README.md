- Structural Preparation for Unified API/Scraping Architecture: The data layer now supports both API and scraping-based data retrieval for tiles, with a unified, type-safe, and testable architecture. Added `fetchAndParse` to `dataFetcher`, introduced a `dataParser` registry, updated types/interfaces, and extended unit tests for the new logic. This enables consistent, reliable data loading for all tiles, regardless of data source, and ensures robust error handling and caching.

- Tile Categories and Sidebar Grouping: Tiles in the sidebar are now grouped by category (Weather, Time, Macroeconomics, Finance). Each group has a title and separator, with no extra containers or icons. Sidebar item size, padding, and hotkey functionality are unchanged. This improves navigation and discoverability for users.

- Dragboard Separation and Modular Dashboard: The Dragboard is now a standalone, modular dashboard framework. All interactions with Dragboard are routed through its public interface, ensuring a stable, predictable user experience and enabling easy integration or extraction as a reusable library. Sidebar and other features are fully decoupled from Dragboard internals, and documentation is updated to reflect the new interface and usage.

- Refactor Cryptocurrency Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Cryptocurrency tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Weather Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Weather tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Time Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Time tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Federal Funds Rate Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Federal Funds Rate tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Euribor Rate Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Euribor Rate tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor GDX ETF Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The GDX ETF tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Uranium Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Uranium tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndParse`) and a registered dataParser for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit test covers HTML parsing and the main data flow, and all scraping calls are mocked for reliability.

- Refactor Precious Metals Tile to Unified Data Architecture: The Precious Metals tile now uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- Implement Earthquake Tile with Unified Data Architecture: The Earthquake tile uses the unified dataFetcher (`fetchAndMap`) and a registered dataMapper for all data access. The implementation is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new architecture. Unit tests comprehensively cover data, error, and loading states, and all API calls are mocked for reliability.

- PRP-1752683071300-11-typhoon-tile.md: Implemented Typhoon tile using the unified dataFetcher and dataMapper architecture with the CWB API. Defined type-safe API and tile data types, registered a dataMapper, and created a robust data hook. Added comprehensive unit tests (mocked API), covering loading, error, and data states. All requirements for accessibility, caching, and performance were met. Lint and tests pass, and the tile is fully integrated into the dashboard system.
