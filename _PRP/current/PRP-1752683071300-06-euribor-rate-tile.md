# PRP: Refactor Euribor Rate Tile to Unified Data Architecture

## Feature Overview

Refactor the Euribor Rate tile to use the new unified data fetching architecture, ensuring it uses `fetchAndMap` for API retrieval (ECB JSON endpoint) and is fully type-safe, testable, and consistent with the new structure. No scraping fallback is used; the tile uses only the ECB API.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see up-to-date Euribor rate data in the dashboard.
- As a developer, I want the Euribor Rate tile to use the centralized dataFetcher and dataMapper for all data access, using only the ECB API.

## Technical Requirements

- Update the Euribor Rate tile’s data hook to use `fetchAndMap` from `dataFetcher` for the ECB API.
- Ensure the tile’s dataMapper is registered and used correctly.
- Update types/interfaces as needed for consistency.
- Add or update unit tests for the tile’s data hook and data mapping.

## UI/UX Considerations

- Tile must display loading, error, and data states consistently.
- No changes to the visual design unless required for error/loading handling.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for the data hook and data mapping.
- Mock all API calls in tests.
- Ensure error and loading states are tested.

## Accessibility Requirements

- Tile must remain accessible (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

## Performance Considerations

- Ensure caching and background refresh logic is respected.

## Implementation Steps

1. Refactor the tile’s data hook to use `fetchAndMap` for ECB API.
2. Ensure the dataMapper is registered and used.
3. Update types/interfaces as needed.
4. Add/update unit tests.
5. Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues.
6. Perform structure check and fix inconsistencies.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking data flow or incorrect mapping. **Mitigation:** Add comprehensive tests and verify tile works after refactor.
