# PRP-1718040000000-01-unified-local-storage

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name

Unified Local Storage & App State Management

### Brief Description

A complete overhaul of how Nerdboard stores and retrieves user data, providing a seamless, reliable, and consistent experience for all app settings and tile data. This update ensures all user preferences and dashboard states are preserved and restored accurately across sessions.

### User Value

Users will benefit from a more robust, reliable, and transparent experience: their theme, sidebar state, and all tile data will persist as expected, even after closing or refreshing the app. The system will be more resilient to errors, and users will always start with sensible defaults if no data is found (except for tiles, which will be null if no data exists).

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** Nerdboard user  
**I want** my app settings and dashboard data to be saved and restored automatically  
**So that** I can pick up right where I left off, every time I use the app

### Additional User Stories

- **As a** user, **I want** my theme and sidebar preferences to be remembered, **So that** the app always looks and feels the way I like.
- **As a** user, **I want** each dashboard tile to remember its last state and data, **So that** I don’t have to reconfigure or reload information.
- **As a** user, **I want** the app to handle storage errors gracefully, **So that** I’m not disrupted by technical issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- All app settings and tile data are saved and restored via a unified storage system
- No part of the app accesses local storage directly; all use the storage manager
- Default values are provided if no data is found (except for tiles, which are left as null)
- Storage errors are logged to the console
- All data is properly typed and validated
- Internal caching ensures the latest data is always available during a session

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Storage operations are fast and do not block the UI
- The system is resilient to storage failures
- The system is compatible with all supported browsers

## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure (User-Facing)

- **Theme**: `enum AppTheme { light, dark }`
- **Data Version**: `dataVersion: timestamp` (automatically updated when storage structure changes)
- **App Config**:
  ```ts
  appConfig: {
    isSidebarCollapsed: boolean,
    theme: AppTheme
  }
  ```
- **Tile Config**:

  ```ts
  tileConfig: {
    [tileName: string]: {
      data: { /* custom data defined by tiles */ } | null,
      lastDataRequest: number,
      lastDataRequestSuccessful: boolean
    }
  }
  ```

  - If there is no tile data, it is left as null and no default tiles are created.

### Storage Manager API

- All storage operations (get, set, remove, clear) are exposed via a single service
- All app code interacts with local storage only through this service
- The service provides typed methods for appConfig and tileConfig
- Internal caching keeps the most current data in memory; loads from storage on app init
- Console logging is used for any storage operation failures

#### Example API

```ts
// Example TypeScript interface
interface StorageManager {
  getAppConfig(): AppConfig;
  setAppConfig(config: AppConfig): void;
  getTileConfig(tileName: string): TileConfig | null;
  setTileConfig(tileName: string, config: TileConfig): void;
  getDataVersion(): number;
  // ...other typed methods
}
```

### Typing

- All data is strictly typed using TypeScript interfaces and enums
- Data validation is performed on load and before save

### Default State

- If no appConfig is found, use:
  ```ts
  const defaultAppConfig = {
    isSidebarCollapsed: false,
    theme: AppTheme.light,
  };
  ```
- If no tile data is found, leave as null (do not create default tiles)

### Error Handling

- All storage errors are logged to the console
- The app continues to function with in-memory defaults if storage is unavailable

### Internal Caching

- The storage manager maintains an in-memory cache of the latest data
- Data is loaded from local storage only on app initialization
- All subsequent reads are from the cache; writes update both cache and storage

## UI/UX Considerations

- No visible change to the UI, but users will notice improved reliability and consistency
- All settings and dashboard states persist across sessions
- Errors are handled silently, with only console logging for advanced users/developers

## Code Example

```ts
// Example usage in a React component
import { useStorageManager } from 'src/services/storageManager';

const Sidebar = () => {
  const { appConfig, setAppConfig } = useStorageManager();
  // ...
  const handleCollapse = () => {
    setAppConfig({ ...appConfig, isSidebarCollapsed: !appConfig.isSidebarCollapsed });
  };
  // ...
};
```

## Testing Requirements

- All storage operations are covered by unit tests
- Simulated storage failures are tested to ensure graceful degradation
- Tests confirm that defaults are used when no data is present
- Tests confirm that tile data is left as null if not present
- Tests confirm that no part of the app accesses localStorage directly

## Performance Considerations

- Storage reads are cached in memory for fast access
- Data is loaded from storage only on app initialization
- No unnecessary writes or reads to local storage

## Accessibility Requirements

- No direct impact, but ensures that user preferences (such as theme) are always respected

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Storage quota exceeded or unavailable
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Log errors, use in-memory fallback, notify user if critical
- **Risk**: Data migration issues after structure changes
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Use `dataVersion` to manage migrations and provide defaults

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: User confusion if settings are lost
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Always provide sensible defaults and never block the UI
