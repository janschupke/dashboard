# Nerdboard Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This refactoring plan addresses the requirements defined in README.md and INIT.md to improve the codebase quality, structure, and adherence to project standards. The plan focuses on eliminating hardcoded values, improving testing infrastructure, enhancing code organization, and ensuring consistent patterns throughout the application.

## User-Facing Feature Descriptions

### 1. Enhanced Theme System Integration

Users will experience a more consistent and maintainable visual design with all colors properly themed through the design system. The application will have better visual consistency and easier customization capabilities.

### 2. Improved Error Handling and User Feedback

Users will see more informative error messages and better loading states when data fails to load or when network issues occur. The application will provide clearer feedback about what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

### 3. Enhanced Accessibility Features

Users with disabilities will have better keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and improved focus management throughout the dashboard interface.

### 4. Better Performance and Responsiveness

Users will experience faster loading times, smoother animations, and better responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices.

### 5. More Robust Data Handling

Users will see more reliable data updates with better caching, retry mechanisms, and fallback options when external APIs are unavailable.

### 6. Improved Code Quality and Maintainability

Developers will benefit from a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with better separation of concerns, consistent patterns, and comprehensive testing coverage.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Eliminate All Hardcoded Values

- Replace remaining hardcoded colors in theme.ts and tailwind.config.js with CSS variables
- Extract all magic numbers to constants
- Move all hardcoded strings to constants files
- Ensure all components use theme classes consistently

### 2. Implement Comprehensive API Mocking Strategy

- Create centralized mock API service for all external API calls
- Replace real API calls in tests with consistent mocked responses
- Implement proper error simulation for API failure scenarios
- Add mock data factories for consistent test data generation
- Ensure all API service tests use mocked endpoints
- Create mock implementations for CoinGecko API and Precious Metals API
- Add proper timeout and network error simulation
- Implement cache behavior testing with mocked APIs

#### API Mocking Implementation Details

- **Mock Service Structure**: Create `src/test/mocks/apiMockService.ts` with centralized mock logic
- **Mock Data Factories**: Implement factories for cryptocurrency and precious metals data
- **Error Scenarios**: Mock network errors, timeouts, and API failures
- **Cache Testing**: Mock cache behavior and expiration scenarios
- **Response Consistency**: Ensure mock responses match real API structure
- **Test Isolation**: Prevent tests from making real network calls
- **Mock Configuration**: Allow easy configuration of mock responses per test

### 3. Fix Testing Infrastructure Issues

- Resolve failing tests in Dashboard.test.tsx, Sidebar.test.tsx, Tile.test.tsx
- Replace all real API calls in tests with comprehensive mocked APIs
- Implement proper API mocking strategy for all external services
- Fix API service tests with proper mocking
- Improve test coverage to meet >80% requirement
- Ensure all tests pass consistently

### 4. Improve Code Structure and Organization

- Consolidate theme system between theme.ts and tailwind.config.js
- Ensure proper separation of concerns in tile components
- Improve file organization and naming conventions
- Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces

### 5. Enhance Error Handling and User Experience

- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Add better loading states and skeleton components
- Improve error messages and user feedback
- Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls

### 6. Optimize Performance and Bundle Size

- Implement code splitting for better performance
- Optimize bundle size and loading times
- Add proper caching strategies
- Improve component rendering performance

### 7. Strengthen Accessibility Features

- Add proper ARIA labels and roles
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Ensure proper focus management
- Add screen reader support

### 8. Improve Data Management and API Integration

- Enhance API service error handling
- Implement proper caching mechanisms
- Add retry logic for failed requests
- Improve data validation and type safety

### 9. Enhance Code Quality Standards

- Ensure all components follow consistent patterns
- Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Implement proper prop validation
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all components

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Theme consolidation might break existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental changes with thorough testing
- **Risk**: Test fixes might introduce new issues
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage and validation
- **Risk**: API mocking might not cover all edge cases
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive mock data and error scenarios
- **Risk**: Performance optimizations might affect functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual implementation with monitoring

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: Visual changes might affect user experience
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure visual appearance remains consistent
- **Risk**: Accessibility improvements might affect existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with accessibility tools

## Implementation Strategy

### Approach
