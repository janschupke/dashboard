# Performance Optimization: Fix Re-render and Infinite Loop Risks

## Feature Overview

The Nerdboard dashboard application has several performance issues that need to be addressed to prevent unnecessary re-renders and potential infinite loops. This refactoring will optimize component rendering, fix hook dependencies, and improve overall application performance.

## User Stories

- Users should experience smooth, responsive dashboard interactions without lag
- Dashboard tiles should update efficiently without causing unnecessary re-renders
- Data fetching should not cause infinite loops or memory leaks
- The application should maintain high performance even with multiple tiles

## Technical Requirements

### Re-render Issues to Fix

1. **TileGrid Component**: Currently calls all data hooks on every render, even for non-existent tiles
2. **Missing Memoization**: Components lack React.memo and proper useMemo usage
3. **Object Recreation**: New objects and functions created on every render
4. **Hook Dependencies**: Incorrect dependency arrays in useCallback and useEffect
5. **Interval Management**: Improper cleanup of setInterval calls

### Infinite Loop Risks to Address

1. **useCallback Dependencies**: Circular dependencies in data fetching hooks
2. **useEffect Dependencies**: Missing or incorrect dependencies causing re-runs
3. **State Updates**: State updates triggering unnecessary re-renders
4. **Context Updates**: Context value changes causing cascading re-renders

## UI/UX Considerations

- Maintain existing functionality while improving performance
- Ensure smooth animations and transitions
- Preserve accessibility features
- Keep responsive design intact

## Testing Requirements

- Verify no infinite loops occur during data fetching
- Ensure components only re-render when necessary
- Test memory usage and cleanup
- Validate all existing functionality still works

## Accessibility Requirements

- Maintain all existing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Ensure screen readers continue to work properly
- Preserve focus management during re-renders

## Performance Considerations

- Reduce unnecessary re-renders by 80%
- Eliminate infinite loop risks
- Optimize memory usage
- Improve bundle size through better tree-shaking
