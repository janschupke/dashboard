## Feature Overview

### Feature Name

Enhanced Data Management with Local Storage and Smart Refresh

### Brief Description

Improve the dashboard's data handling by implementing local storage for tile data, extending refresh intervals to 10 minutes, and adding user controls for data management.

### User Value

Users will experience faster dashboard loading, reduced API calls, better reliability when APIs are unavailable, and more control over data refresh timing.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** dashboard user
**I want** my dashboard to load quickly and work reliably even when APIs are slow or unavailable
**So that** I can always access my important data without waiting for external services

### Additional User Stories

- **As a** dashboard user, **I want** to see when my data will next refresh, **So that** I know how current my information is
- **As a** dashboard user, **I want** to manually refresh all data when needed, **So that** I can get the latest information on demand
- **As a** dashboard user, **I want** clear error messages when data is unavailable, **So that** I understand what's happening and why
- **As a** dashboard user, **I want** my dashboard to work offline with cached data, **So that** I can still access information when internet is slow

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Dashboard loads instantly with cached data from previous sessions
- [ ] All tiles refresh data automatically every 10 minutes
- [ ] Top panel displays countdown timer showing time until next full refresh
- [ ] Manual refresh button in top panel allows immediate data update
- [ ] When APIs are unavailable, tiles show helpful error messages instead of failing completely
- [ ] Dashboard remembers data between browser sessions and page reloads
- [ ] Data older than 10 minutes triggers fresh API calls on page load

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Dashboard loads within 2 seconds on subsequent visits
- [ ] Local storage usage is optimized to prevent browser storage limits
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and explain the situation clearly
- [ ] Refresh countdown is accurate and updates in real-time

## UI/UX Considerations

### User Interface

- **Top Panel Enhancement**: Add countdown timer and refresh button to existing top panel
- **Error States**: Design clear error messages that appear within tiles when data is unavailable
- **Loading States**: Maintain existing loading indicators for fresh data fetches
- **Visual Feedback**: Show when data is from cache vs fresh from API

### User Experience

- **Seamless Loading**: Users see cached data immediately while fresh data loads in background
- **Transparent Operation**: Users understand when data is cached vs fresh
- **Control**: Users can force refresh when they need latest data
- **Reliability**: Dashboard works even when external services are down

### Accessibility Requirements

- **Screen Reader Support**: Countdown timer and refresh button are properly announced
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Refresh button is accessible via keyboard
- **Error Communication**: Error messages are accessible to screen readers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Storage Foundation

- [ ] Implement local storage for all tile data
- [ ] Add 10-minute refresh interval constant
- [ ] Modify data fetching to save to local storage

### Phase 2: User Interface Enhancements

- [ ] Add countdown timer to top panel
- [ ] Add manual refresh button to top panel
- [ ] Implement error message display within tiles

### Phase 3: Smart Data Management

- [ ] Implement data age checking on page load
- [ ] Add background refresh for stale data
- [ ] Optimize local storage usage

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics

- **Dashboard Load Time**: Reduced from current time to under 2 seconds
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduced complaints about slow loading or API failures
- **Reliability**: Dashboard works 99% of the time even with API issues

### Technical Metrics

- **API Call Reduction**: 90% reduction in unnecessary API calls
- **Local Storage Usage**: Efficient use of browser storage
- **Error Rate**: Clear error handling for all failure scenarios

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Local storage limits exceeded with large datasets
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Implement data cleanup and size monitoring

- **Risk**: Stale data causing user confusion
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Clear visual indicators for data freshness

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: Users not understanding cached vs fresh data
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Clear UI indicators and helpful tooltips

## Documentation Requirements

### User Documentation

- **Help Text**: Tooltips explaining countdown timer and refresh button
- **Error Messages**: Clear explanations when data is unavailable
- **User Guide**: Brief explanation of new features in dashboard
