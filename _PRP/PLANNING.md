# Feature Planning: Unified Local Storage System

## Feature Overview

### Feature Name

Unified Local Storage & App State Management

### Brief Description

A complete overhaul of how Nerdboard stores and retrieves user data, providing a seamless, reliable, and consistent experience for all app settings and tile data. This update ensures all user preferences and dashboard states are preserved and restored accurately across sessions.

### User Value

Users will benefit from a more robust, reliable, and transparent experience: their theme, sidebar state, and all tile data will persist as expected, even after closing or refreshing the app. The system will be more resilient to errors, and users will always start with sensible defaults if no data is found.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a** Nerdboard user  
**I want** my app settings and dashboard data to be saved and restored automatically  
**So that** I can pick up right where I left off, every time I use the app

### Additional User Stories

- **As a** user, **I want** my theme and sidebar preferences to be remembered, **So that** the app always looks and feels the way I like.
- **As a** user, **I want** each dashboard tile to remember its last state and data, **So that** I don’t have to reconfigure or reload information.
- **As a** user, **I want** the app to handle storage errors gracefully, **So that** I’m not disrupted by technical issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] All app settings and tile data are saved and restored via a unified storage system
- [ ] No part of the app accesses local storage directly; all use the storage manager
- [ ] Default values are provided if no data is found
- [ ] Storage errors are logged to the console
- [ ] All data is properly typed and validated
- [ ] Internal caching ensures the latest data is always available during a session

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Storage operations are fast and do not block the UI
- [ ] The system is resilient to storage failures
- [ ] The system is compatible with all supported browsers

## Technical Requirements

### Data Structure (User-Facing)

- **Theme**: `enum AppTheme { light, dark }`
- **Data Version**: `dataVersion: timestamp` (automatically updated when storage structure changes)
- **App Config**:
  ```js
  appConfig: {
    isSidebarCollapsed: boolean,
    theme: AppTheme
  }
  ```
- **Tile Config**:
  ```js
  tileConfig: {
    [tileName]: {
      data: {custom data defined by tiles} | null,
      lastDataRequest: number,
      lastDataRequestSuccessful: boolean
    }
  }
  ```

### Implementation Details (User-Facing)

- All user preferences and tile data are automatically saved and restored
- If no data is found, the app uses sensible defaults (e.g., default theme, sidebar open). If there is no tile data, it is left as null and no default tiles are created.
- Users never have to manually save or restore their settings
- If a storage operation fails, the app continues to work and logs the error for troubleshooting

## UI/UX Considerations

- No visible change to the UI, but users will notice improved reliability and consistency
- All settings and dashboard states persist across sessions
- Errors are handled silently, with only console logging for advanced users/developers

## Testing Requirements

- All storage operations are covered by unit tests
- Simulated storage failures are tested to ensure graceful degradation
- Tests confirm that defaults are used when no data is present

## Performance Considerations

- Storage reads are cached in memory for fast access
- Data is loaded from storage only on app initialization
- No unnecessary writes or reads to local storage

## Accessibility Requirements

- No direct impact, but ensures that user preferences (such as theme) are always respected

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Storage quota exceeded or unavailable
  - **Impact**: Medium
  - **Mitigation**: Log errors, use in-memory fallback, notify user if critical

- **Risk**: Data migration issues after structure changes
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Use `dataVersion` to manage migrations and provide defaults

### User Experience Risks

- **Risk**: User confusion if settings are lost
  - **Impact**: Low
  - **Mitigation**: Always provide sensible defaults and never block the UI

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

- [ ] Design and implement the unified storage manager
- [ ] Define and type all data structures
- [ ] Implement default state logic

### Phase 2: Enhancement

- [ ] Integrate storage manager throughout the app
- [ ] Add error logging and internal caching
- [ ] Update all components to use the manager exclusively

### Phase 3: Polish

- [ ] Comprehensive testing (including error and migration scenarios)
- [ ] Performance and reliability optimizations
- [ ] Documentation and developer guidance

## Success Metrics

- **User Experience**: Settings and dashboard state always persist as expected
- **Technical**: 100% of storage operations go through the manager; no direct localStorage access
- **Reliability**: No user reports of lost settings or data

## Documentation Requirements

- Update README to describe the new storage system and its benefits
- Add code comments and usage examples for developers

## Post-Implementation

- Monitor for user reports of lost data or settings
- Track error logs for storage failures
- Plan for future enhancements (e.g., cloud sync, import/export)
